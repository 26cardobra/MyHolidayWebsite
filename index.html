        <p>
         Thanksgiving is a national holiday celebrated on various dates in October and November in the United States, Canada, Saint Lucia, Liberia,
         and unofficially in countries like Brazil, Germany and the Philippines. It is also observed in the Dutch town of Leiden and the Australian territory of Norfolk Island. 
         It began as a day of giving thanks for the blessings of the harvest and of the preceding year. Various similarly named harvest festival holidays occur throughout the world during autumn. 
         Although Thanksgiving has historical roots in religious and cultural traditions, it has long been celebrated as a secular holiday as well.

            <h4>What Thanksgiving means</h4>
            <p>The origins of this holiday in America date back to 1621, but Canada’s Thanksgiving is even older.
               It dates back to 1578 in modern-day Nunavut, when English explorer Martin Frobisher celebrated his safe arrival in the arctic.
               The holiday’s Canadian roots can be traced centuries earlier among First Nations peoples (Canada’s indigenous peoples), who celebrated bountiful harvests with dancing and feasting.
               Canada’s Thanksgiving is celebrated annually on the second Monday in October. (To read more click on Source)</p>

            <h4>Thanksgiving Day</h4>
            <p>Thanksgiving Day, annual national holiday in the United States and Canada celebrating the harvest and other blessings of the past year.
               Americans generally believe that their Thanksgiving is modeled on a 1621 harvest feast shared by the English colonists (Pilgrims) of Plymouth and the Wampanoag people.
               The American holiday is particularly rich in legend and symbolism, and the traditional fare of the Thanksgiving meal typically includes turkey, bread stuffing, potatoes, cranberries, and pumpkin pie.
               With respect to vehicular travel, the holiday is often the busiest of the year, as family members gather with one another. (To read more click on Source)</p>

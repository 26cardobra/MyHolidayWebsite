            <h4>For this project you just need colored paper, scissors and glue plus recycled cardboard such as a cereal box.</h4>
            <p>
             <ol class="facts">
                <li>Draw a handprint on the cardboard and cut it out, this is your handprint template.</li>
                <li>Using the template as a guide, draw and cut out multiple hand-prints from colored paper, I used red, orange and yellow.</li>
                <li>Cut out the turkey head, body, beak, feet, wattle (that funny red piece that hangs from the turkey’s chin) and other accents from colored paper.</li>
                <li>Have your preschooler put it all together using glue and a background piece of paper, I used brown.</li>

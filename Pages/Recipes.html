          <h3> Here are some quick tips for the main event(turkey)</h3>
          <ul class="Facts">
            <li>The first Thanksgiving was celebrated in 1621 over a three day harvest festival. It included 50 Pilgrims, 90 Wampanoag Indians, and lasted three days. It is believed by historians that only five women were present.</li>
            <li>Turkey wasn’t on the menu at the first Thanksgiving. Venison, duck, goose, oysters, lobster, eel, and fish were likely served, alongside pumpkins and cranberries (but not pumpkin pie or cranberry sauce!).</li>
            <li>The average number of calories consumed on Thanksgiving is 4,500.</li>

            <h4>Buttermilk Mashed Potatoes</h4>
            <p>Buttery, fluffy mashed potatoes are an essential part of Thanksgiving. Russet potatoes make light mashed potatoes, to play better with the rest of the rich holiday dishes on the table. (You can use Yukon Golds instead for a richer, creamier dish.) Buttermilk also keeps the potatoes light, but you can swap in sour cream, crème fraîche or heavy cream, if you like.
